#Portfolio
This website is created as a portfolio for a second year IT student passionate about front-end. 
It is fully designed by HTML, Vanilla CSS and JS for some functionality.
This website is responsive for all sizes.
No backend is yet implemented due to the restrictions of GitHub Pages.

Any feedbacks and tips will be highly appreciated.
Cheers!
